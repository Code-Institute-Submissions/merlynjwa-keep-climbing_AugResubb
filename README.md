### Title Bar & Navigation

![Title Bar & Navigation when the viewport's width is greater than or equal to 768px](./docs/title-bar-768px-and-greater.webp)

When the viewport is wider than 767px, all the navigation links are rendered next to each other horizontally.

![Title Bar & Navigation when the viewport's width is less than 768px](./docs/title-bar-less-than-768px.webp)

For viewports narrower than 768px, the navigation links disappear and a hamburger icon is rendered on the left hand side.

When the hamburger icon is selected, a menu containing the navigation links appears beneath the icon and on top of the page.
