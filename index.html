      <h2>Why you should climb</h2>
      <p>
Climbing is a great way to exercise nearly every muscle in the body.
Through gradual development and practice, climbing will help to
improve your grip and control of your balance.
      </p>
      <p>
Climbing also serves as a great source of mental exercise.
It requires problem solving on the part of the climber to navigate
the rock face and to find which techniques are the most
effective for them to get to the top.
      </p>
      <p>
As well as your body and mind, climbing develops your social bonds.
Whether you are joining us on one of our events or come to the centre
with a climbing partner, the continual reliance on each other in order
to climb safely and with ease builds trust between you and others.
