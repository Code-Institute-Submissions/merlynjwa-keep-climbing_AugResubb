      <h2>Why you should climb</h2>
      <p>
Climbing is a great way to exercise nearly every muscle in the body.
Through gradual development and practice, climbing will help to
improve your grip and control of your balance.
      </p>
      <p>
Climbing also serves as a great source of mental exercise.
It requires problem solving on the part of the climber in order to
navigate the rock face which they are faced with and to decide which
techniques are the most efficient and possible for them to use to get
to the top.
      </p>
      <p>
As well as your body and mind, climbing develops your social bonds.
Whether you are joining us on one of our events or come to the centre
with a climbing partner, the continual reliance on each other in order
to climb safely and with ease builds trust between you and others.
